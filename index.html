    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Tech Stuff was founded in 2020 when a group of aspiring entrepreneurs unexpectedly came together to accomplish a single goal. To unlock the creative potential of millions of people. The idea came to us when we relalized we needed a UI designer but none was to be found. We then thought, if only we had the right tools we would be able to do so much more, and began to wonder how many other people were in the same conundrum. And thus, we set out to find a solution - and one week later, Tech Stuff was born. Here to bring access to the tools you need to do you, sign up now and unlock your potential.</p>
