What problem does your app solve?
  Like AirBnB but for high end electronics. Tired of paying ridiculous fees for camera and other equipment rentals? Bypass the middleman and rent from a real person!


Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
- Two user types: Equipment Owners and Renters
- Users can log in and create a profile.

- Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete rental data. - A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have for rent and ask to rent an item.
